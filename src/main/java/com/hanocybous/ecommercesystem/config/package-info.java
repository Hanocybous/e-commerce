/**
 * This package contains configuration classes responsible for application setup and customization.
 * <p>
 * Configuration classes play a crucial role in configuring various aspects of the application,
 * such as database connections, security settings, logging, and more. They help customize
 * the behavior of the application and enable dependency injection.
 *
 * <p>It is important to follow best practices when designing configuration classes, including
 * proper use of annotations, separation of concerns, and keeping configuration logic clean
 * and organized.
