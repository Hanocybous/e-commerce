/**
 * This package contains DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes used for data exchange.
 * <p>
 * DTO classes are designed to transfer data between different parts of the application,
 * such as between the front end and back end. They are often used to encapsulate data for
 * specific use cases and may differ from entity classes to optimize data transfer.
 *
 * <p>DTO classes should be simple, lightweight, and may not contain business logic. They
 * are often used to represent a subset of entity data, avoiding over-fetching from the
 * database.
